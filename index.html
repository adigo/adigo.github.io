                <h1>Welcome to Adigo's website!</h1>
                <h2 id="who">Who is Adigo?</h2>
                <p>In case you wonder, Adigo is just my nickname. My real name is Cheng-Yi Lee. I was born in Taipei County(now became New Taipei City), Taiwan and currently live in Las Cruces, New Mexico in the U.S. Since I am not a native speaker, writing anything in English is a real challenge to me so, please bear with me for my lousy English.</p>
                
                <h2 id="whatmean">What does &quot;Adigo&quot; mean?</h2>
                <p>I am actually not sure! </p>
                <p>During my childhood, one of my neighbor started calling me A-Di-Go. &quot;A-Di&quot; means &quot;Little Brother&quot; I believe, and &quot;Go&quot; probably means nothing.</p>
                <p>There is one culture thing I need to tell you about Taiwan, which is, in every IT companies, people call each other by their Enlish name, therefore, you got to have an English name. So when I got my first job in Taipei as a System Engineer and people asked me what is my English name, The first name came accross my mind is &quot;Adigo&quot;!</p>
                <P>After I came here in the States, since nobody can pronounce &quot;Adigo&quot; correctly as it is actually not English, and even worse, nobody can pronounce my real name Cheng-Yi correct either, I started using different names. My co-workers call me Cheng, people in the church call me Jerry, and Starbucks clarks calls me Lee. However, deep inside my heart, I am Adigo!</P>
                
                <h2 id="whatlearn">What can I learn from this website?</h2>
                <p>Nothing!</p>
                <p>Or at least, you can learn something about me. This is just a place for me to write down some of my thoughts, ideas, or whatever I've learned day by day so that I won't forget. Believe me, the amount of things we can memorize decrease as our ages increase. That's why I really need to force myself to start writing something, anything!</p>
                <p>Anyways, welcome to Adigo's website!</p>
